With respect to R Code
important_code is really important in that it loads all of the files and manipulates them for use in the other code documents. These are then used and manipulated in the other files.


the random_forest code contains a short code that runs an RF algorithm using a data frame and a vector as the 2 inputs. The data frame is based on the df.

The density code looks at modeling population density based on light density in different tracts. the tract_comb comes from turning env_state into a "Sf" and subsequently a data.frame and it contains useful values such as light mean for a given area. combined with shape area you can look at density there.

the mcda file covers the smart and k means clustering techniques.
